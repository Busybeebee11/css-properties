                <i>why CSS is important?</i>
            </h4>
            <p>CSS known as <strong><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em></strong> as the name implies, are style sheets used and 
                are considered to be highly effective tool to HTML that provides easy control over layout and
                presentation of website pages by separating content from design. <br> CSS is important for the following reasons;</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It controls how a web page looks and improves the website's presentation.</li>
                <li>Without it, websites would remain plain text on white backgrounds.</li>
                <li>It provides a set of guidelines by which a browser may place and render any element of HTML: a single
                    page can be rendered in multitude of ways, whether stylistically or even functionally (for the
                    color blind or the blind themselves).</li>
                <li>It is a building block of a website, as one can style a site by applying the various
                    properties it has, which are used to present and change the skin of websites in different ways.</li>
                <li>It makes updates easier and smoother.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>
                <!-- <strong>"Third section”</strong> -->
            </h1>
            <h4>
                <i>what is the difference between paddings, margins, and borders?</i>
            </h4>

            <h5>Paddings</h5>
            <p>Padding is <span>the space between an element’s border and the element’s content</span>. It shows the container
                background around the element in it. Padding can be affected by background colors as it
                clears the area around the content and does not allow negative values.</p>

            <ul> 
                <h6>Uses of paddings</h6>
                <li>Add space between content and its border.</li>
                <li>Change the size of an element.</li>
                <li>It controls the space inside an element and it determines how elements look and sit within a container.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Margins</h5>
            <p>A margin is <span>the space around an element’s border</span>. It controls the space outside an element and is completely transparent as it does not have any background color. It can take a negative or any float number</p>
            <ul> 
                <h6>Uses of margins</h6>
                <li>Change an Element’s position on the page.</li>
                <li>Set the distance between nearby elements.</li>
                <li>Overlap elements.</li>
                <li>Move an element up or down on a page as well as left or right.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Borders</h5>
            <p>The border is any kind of line (solid, dotted, dashed...) surrounding the box, if present <span>the border is the perimeter of the box</span>. They can be invisible or thick colored lines.
            Borders can wrap immediately around an element, or it may look further away from an element if more padding has been
            applied to the element.</p>
            <ul>
                <h6>Uses for borders</h6>
                <li>The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.</li>
                <li>It set visible border width to most HTML elements within the body.</li>
            </ul>
